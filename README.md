I recently graduated from the University of Delaware with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in CyberSecurity.  I want to apply this degree in a career as a Software Engineer.

If you want to connect with me or get more information on my education & experience you can:

### Current Work:
I am passionate about building systems that bring value to their users and I am excited to learn all of the new ways that we can use software to affect real change in people's lives.
- 🌱 I am currently learning React, building user centered software has always been a priority for me and React really empowers developers to focus on the user experience when building software
- 🔨 I am currently working on a few React projects including a sorting algorithm visualizer and a pathfinding algorithm visualizer; check out the projects at the following links; [sorting visualizer](https://willk0814.github.io/sorting_visualizer/), [pathfinding visualizer](https://willk0814.github.io/pathfinding_visualizer/)
