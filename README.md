I am currently pursuing my Masters of Science in Machine Learning part-time at Stevens Institute of Technology.  I want to apply all that I have learned throughout my continuing education to a full-time software engineering role.

If you want to connect with me or get more information on my education & experience you can:
- 📫 drop me an email at wkoenig0814@gmail.com
- 🖥️ check out my website [here](https://willkoenig.vercel.app)

### Current Work:
I am passionate about building systems that bring value to their users and I am excited to learn all of the new ways that I can use software to affect real change in people's lives.

🌱 I love working with React and I am always trying to develop my skills in this area, I check out a few of the repositories to below to see some of my work in React
- 🔨 [PathFinding Visualizer](https://willk0814.github.io/pathfinding_visualizer/) &rarr; A React app that demonstrates the behvior of popular path finding algorithms as they explore weight and unweighted grids
- 🔨 [Sorting Visualizer](https://willk0814.github.io/sorting_visualizer/) &rarr; A React app that demonstrates the steps taken by different comparison based sorting algorithms as they sort an array
- 🔨 [Just Notes](https://github.com/willk0814/justNotes) &rarr; A full stack application developed with the MERN stack that offers a simple note-taking experience
- 🔨 [Portfolio Website](https://willkoenig.vercel.app) &rarr; My portfolio website; check it out to get more information about my skills, education, experience, and to see some of my projects

<br>
🌱 As I continue my education I am sharpening my skills in python and becoming more and more comfortable in many of the libraries and practices that are so key to machine learning

- 🔨 [Hand Written Number Recongition](https://github.com/willk0814/numberRecognition) &rarr; a Neural Network that I built without the use of any libraries and trained using feed forward and back propagation to recognize hand written numbers 0-9
 
Look through my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about anything that I have built or are interested in collaborating on any projects.
